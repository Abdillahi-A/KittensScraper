# KittensScraper
Made this to practice a bit of webscraping.

##What does it do?
Get's cute images of kittens from the web, and downloads it to folder on your machine.

##NB:
Use KittensV2 as it allows you to specify how many pages you'd like to scrape. Also I cleaned it up with functions, so its more readable.

# Requirements
All you really need to get up an running is to: 

`pip install: requests, beautifulsoup4`
