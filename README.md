# KittensScraper
## Motivation
I really enjoy webscraping, and this was a silly way to practice it. Prior to this I had no experience scraping data from multiple pages. So not only was this a fun experiment, I learned something new!

## What does it do?
Get's cute images of kittens from the web, and downloads it to folder on your machine.
