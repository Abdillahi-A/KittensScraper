# KittensScraper
### Webscraping practice. 

Get's cute images of kittens from the web, and downloads it to folder on your machine.

Use KittensV2 as it allows you to specify how many pages you'd like to scrape. Also I cleaned it up with functions, so its more readable.

# Requirements
All you really need to get up an running is to: 

`pip install: requests, beautifulsoup4`
